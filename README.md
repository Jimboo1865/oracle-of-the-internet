# Oracle of the Internet
This is my submission for project 7C. To access the webpage use the link [Oracle of the Internet](https://jimboo1865.github.io/oracle-of-the-internet/).
## Installation
If you would like to download the package to run it yourself download the files from GitHub and then run these commands. <br>
First install homebrew for mac
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Then run
``` bash
brew install node
```
To check if you have installed node correctly run the commands
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```
If you do not get
```bash
v20.x.x
10.x.x
```
You will need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org) from the web. <br>
Once you have installed node.js you can download the files from GitHub. Once you have opened the files you can run the commands
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
That will provide you with a link that will allow you to open the file locally on your computer and make edits.
## Editing
If you would like to edit this webpage, you should open the files
```
./src/App.css
./src/App.tsx
```
These files are how the webpage is displayed. The App.css page is where the styling is selected, and the App.tsx file is where the page information is found. Most of the other files are automatically generated and should not be changed.
